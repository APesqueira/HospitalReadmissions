    "# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction - part of Capstone project for Coursera-IBM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In October 2016, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we:\n",
    "+ critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate. Based on public studies we proceeded with solid conclusions and based on the learnings of this course\n",
    "+ construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of my own (author of this study: Antonio Pesqueira\n",
    "\n",
    "More instructions provided below. I will also include all the work and data **in this notebook and submit in my Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "+ Data source: https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmission-Reduction/9n3s-kdb3\n",

    "All information of the public data and preliminary analysis can be found in the above links. As well the presentation of this study can be found in GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAnalytical Approach: I would like to decide on the best approach to solve the problem and be able to analyse the correct data part of the exercise. The best model for the specific case might be a classification model to better assess the data and to understand which of them might be more relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tData Requirements: The data would need to in a tabular and structured format , where it will be required to have a unique identifier of the patient ID to better assess and cross-tabling the data between all sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tData Collection: Will be critical to better understand the patients admission, like: excessive inpatient days, admission history, recurring visits, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tModeling and Evaluation: Once the model is under the modelling phase now we can collect the necessary feedback to understand the related evaluation. The following variables and data features now can be assessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tNow the analysts can start sorting and defining the best model with better prediction rates and assess the rights models for hospital admissions. The analysts can start preparing the report to present to the stakeholders and sponsor in order to understand if the departments are ready to apply the model to real case scenarios and based on the training and testing results of the model. Now the report presents a concept for the evaluation of data modelling which is based on existing theoretical approaches and an empirical study conducted by the data science team. The main results of this report with respect to evaluation suggest to focus more on organizational issues of modelling and to better understand the potential areas of improvement, more on process instead of product quality, to consider different application scenarios of this data modelling exercise as well as to distinguish the enterprise-wide evaluation of data modelling as an organizational function from the evaluation of single projects using data modelling. This process step consists of recommendations for the evaluation procedure, persons involved, instruments, the design of important organizational dimensions as well as concrete process measures of the presented model.\n",
